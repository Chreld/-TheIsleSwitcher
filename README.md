# TheIsleSwitcher
The Isle Switcher: A desktop app for switching between Legacy and Evrima for the game 'The Isle' with a single click.

You only need to download the **TheIsleSwitcher.zip** file, unzip it, and run **TheIsleSwitcher.exe** for this to work!

This software will provide you, the user, a one-click shortcut to alter between the Legacy and Evrima version of 'The Isle'. You simply click the button of the version you want to play next. If you only have one installed, you can click on the version that you want to install, and the software will de-activate the version you currently have installed. This software cannot begin the download and installment of the missing version, but it will prepare it so you can install the new version.

TIP:
Make sure your last downloaded version of The Isle was Evrima so steam can detect new updates. Remember to set downloads to NOT be automatic so you can switch to Evrima if your Legacy is activated.

Enjoy!
